This is a long-standing annual event with a broad mathematical outlook across areas of pure and applied mathematics, statistics and OR. It is aimed at bringing together mathematicians at Welsh HEIs, while also welcoming mathematicians from other parts of the UK. <img style="float: right;" src="/files/2017/12/gregynog.jpg" width="350pt" alt="Gregynog" />

It plays an important role in fostering mathematical discussion and collaboration between staff and postgraduates in Wales, both on research topics and on higher education policy, and offers a stimulating environment for postgraduate researchers to present their results with ample time for follow-up discussion.

The following invited plenary speakers have agreed to give keynote lectures:
- [Professor Ruth King](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~rking33/), Edinburgh University, UK: Bayesian inference and hidden Markov models
- [Dr Jane White](http://people.bath.ac.uk/maskajw/), University of Bath, UK: Mathematical Biology
- [Dr Ian Short](http://users.mct.open.ac.uk/is3649/), Open University, UK: Hyperbolic Geometry

The organisers of the Colloquium are [Nick Gill](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill) and [Francis Hunt](http://staff.southwales.ac.uk/users/3853-fhhunt) (University of South Wales School of Mathematics). Some financial support is available for UK-based research students. The Colloquium is supported by an London Mathematical Society (LMS) conference grant.
