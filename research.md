## Published papers on deliberative democracy
 0.  0. [Can we do inclusive politics in urgent times?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13511610.2024.2332229) (with [Brett Hennig](https://www.bretthennig.com/) and Thomas Lord), published online 9 March 2024. Not yet in print.

## Other activity
            
 * I wrote [this note](files/2014/07/alternatingproduct.pdf) in response to [this MathOverflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/169128/finite-groups-factorized-into-two-simple-alternating-groups). Shortly afterwards I realised that Mohammad Reza Darafsheh [had beaten me to it](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2101830), so this note is unlikely to be published.
 * Marcus Hum, Dömötör Pálvölgyi and I answered the MathOverflow question [Is there always a maximum anti-rectangle with a corner square?](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/147013/is-there-always-a-maximum-anti-rectangle-with-a-corner-square). Our answer was cited in [this economics(!) paper](http://econ.biu.ac.il/files/economics/working-papers/2014-01.pdf).
 * A letter [in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/letters/story/0,,1876288,00.html);
 * An article on [free journals in mathematics](http://infochangeindia.org/200806107173/Technology/Features/Knowledge-for-all.html). The article gives some of the reasons why I, and many others, choose to publish in [low-cost or free](http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/BIB/AMS/Price_per_Volume.html) journals.

Soc](http://www.lms.ac.uk/newsletter/10.html#2). I have refereed articles for many different journals, but [I won&#8217;t referee for Elsevier](2014/03/11/letter-to-the-journal-of-algebra/).
            
I am a member of the European Mathematical Society&#8217;s [Committee for Developing Countries](http://ems-cdc.org).
