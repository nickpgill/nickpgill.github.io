## How to find us

Gregynog is located near the quiet village of Tregynon, 6 miles north of Newtown in Powys.

This makes it reachable within 3 hours from all parts of Wales, within 2 hours from Birmingham, Manchester, Chester and Liverpool and just 50 minutes from Shrewsbury.

Rail links are via the Birmingham – Aberystwyth line, and the nearby A483 leads to the motorway network.

## From Newtown

Entering Newtown from the South, keep on the A489 until you reach the traffic lights at McDonald’s. Turn left at the traffic lights (keeping McDonalds on your left). Go over the river bridge following signs for the hospital. Take the fifth turning on the right (opposite the Bell Hotel). Carry on up the hill out of Newtown for approx. 6 miles. The entrance to Gregynog is sign-posted on the left just before the village of Tregynon.

## From Welshpool

Head towards Newtown on the A483 for approx. 4 miles. Turn right towards Berriew (B4390). In Berriew village take the second turning on the left, sign posted Bettws Cedewain 5 miles. In Bettws follow the road round to the right (keeping the New Inn pub on your right) sign-posted Tregynon 2.5 miles. At the next T junction the entrance to Gregynog is sign posted straight opposite.

## For satellite navigation

Use the postcode SY16 3PL, which will bring you into the Hall grounds via the main Estate entrance. From the Berriew direction, it may also direct you to turn right towards Brooks, which is a steep single track road. Please ignore this and continue onto Bettws Cedewain.

Please Note: Google Maps currently displays addresses and directions in a limited number of languages which does not include Welsh, but may do in future as the facility improves..

## Venue

Gregynog is a historic house with Grade 1 listed gardens set in the heart of rural Montgomeryshire. One of Wales’ premier country estates, and the former home of art collectors and public benefactors Gwendoline and Margaret Davies, it offers a welcoming setting in which people of all ages and abilities may discover, experience, participate in, and be inspired by the arts and natural environment.

It is one of Wales’s most unexpected hidden treasures, whose name has echoed down the years since the first elusive references to it by the 12th century poets of the Welsh princes.
