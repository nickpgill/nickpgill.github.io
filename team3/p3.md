If you paid careful attention to the instructions on the first page, then you should know where to go for your first location... If you are struggling,  click here:

<table width="100%" cellspacing="20">
  <tr><td align="center"><button onclick="myFunction()">Hintypoos</button></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Once you are at your first location, click <a href = "p4">here</a>
</p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Remember that you need to know ***what 3 words*** you got as answers to the puzzle.");
}
</script>
