You guys are the last team to get to this destination. It closes at 5pm! So if you are running out of time, then go straight in! If you've enough time, though, you need to compose a limerick and post a video of you reciting it to the WhatsApp group. <b>Make sure you don't give away your location in the video!!!</b> The limerick must start...
</p>
<p align = center>
<i>There once was a man called Steve...</i>
</p>
<p>
(If you don't do the limerick now, do it after you leave!) Now here's your task: You need to go into the treasures gallery and find three numbers connected to inspiring figures or groups:
</p>
 1. Angela Davis was a hero for the 20th Convention of the Communist Party in the year XXXX.
 2. The Greenham women set up XXX peace camps in Britian on 9th November '83.
 3. A letter written by Alan Turing. His phone number was Molesey XXXX.
<p>
Add these three numbers together and you will get a four digit number.  When you enter your answer, don't just press enter, you have to click the button!
</p>
<form>
    <label for="pswd">Enter your answer, a 4 digit number: </label>
    <input type="password" id="pswd">
    <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="checkPswd();" />
</form>
<!--Function to check password the already set password is admin-->
<script type="text/javascript">
    function checkPswd() {
        var confirmPassword = "3454";
        var password = document.getElementById("pswd").value;
        if (password == confirmPassword) {
             window.location="p13";
        }
        else{
            alert("Whoops! Try again!");
        }
    }
</script>
