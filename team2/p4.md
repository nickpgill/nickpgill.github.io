There's a human that you know in this building. Find them! They'll tell you where to go next...
</p>
<p>
They'll also tell you what you need to look for. When you've found it, enter the answer below. Don't just press enter, you have to click the button!
</p>
<form>
    <label for="pswd">Enter your answer, ALL CAPS, NO GAPS! </label>
    <input type="password" id="pswd">
    <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="checkPswd();" />
</form>
<!--Function to check password the already set password is admin-->
<script type="text/javascript">
    function checkPswd() {
        var confirmPassword = "IAMAMAN";
        var password = document.getElementById("pswd").value;
        if (password == confirmPassword) {
             window.location="p5";
        }
        else{
            alert("Whoops! Try again!");
        }
    }
</script>
