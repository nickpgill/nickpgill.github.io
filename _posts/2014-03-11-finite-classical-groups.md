This is the webpage for my course with the [London Taught Course Centre](http://www.ltcc.ac.uk). Practical matters:

  * **Lectures**: There are 5 lectures, given every Monday from 30th September until 28th October 2013, 3:30pm &#8211; 5:30pm at De Morgan house in London. 
  * **Lecture notes**: These will be put online the morning after the lecture is given. Each lecture contains many exercises which students are encouraged to attempt. Answers to starred exercises will be put online after one week. 
  * **Discussion class**: I will run an experimental online discussion class for one hour starting at 2pm on Tuesday 15th October. This is optional and will cover some extra material tangential to the course. 
  * **Exam**: This has happened. Email me if you want solutions.

Course material follows.
                
  * Useful reading: 
      * [Course description](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Preface.pdf), including a list of background texts; 
      * Peter Cameron&#8217;s notes on [Classical Groups](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/class_gps/);
      * Peter Cameron&#8217;s notes on [Projective and polar spaces](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/).</ul> 
  * Lecture notes: 
      * [Lecture 0](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Lecture0.pdf) on _Group theory background_ (this was not covered in class); 
      * [Lecture 1](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Lecture1.pdf) on _Permutation Groups_ and _Fields and Vector Spaces_;

      * [Lecture 3](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Lecture3.pdf) on _Forms and polar spaces_ and _Isometries and Witt&#8217;s Lemma_; 
      * [Lecture 4](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Lecture4.pdf) in which we finish off _Isometries and Witt&#8217;s Lemma_, and then cover _Polar spaces_ and _Symplectic groups_; 
      * [Lecture 5](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/Lecture5.pdf) on _Unitary groups_ and _Orthogonal groups_. </ul>
