My MMath student, Sam Hughes, recently submitted his dissertation entitled "*Representation and character theory of the small {M}athieu groups*"; a copy is <a href = "MMath_Sam.Hughes.pdf">here</a>.

The dissertation studies the ordinary (complex) character theory of *M_{11}* and *M_{12}*; it includes the foundations of character theory, as well as details on how to construct *M_{11}* and *M_{12}* via the notion of "transitive extension". I think Sam has done a beautiful job and should be congratulated!

We are in the process of writing up a paper including some of Sam's results. In fact the paper comes from a slightly different point of view. Our main result is the following:

**Theorem** 
 1. If *G* is a sharply 5-transitive subgroup of Alt(12), then the character table of *G* is given by Table ***.
 2. If *G* is a sharply 4-transitive subgroup of Alt(11), then the character table of *G* is given by Table ***.

The point of this theorem is that we are able to construct the character table of *G* using only the assumption about multiple-transitivity -- there is no direct reference to the Mathieu groups in this paper.

In the course of this research, I asked a question on MathOverflow <a href = "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/293859/what-did-frobenius-prove-about-m-12">here</a>. Now seems a good time to thank the contributors to that discussion, especially Frieder Ladisch, for their help!
