This is the webpage for my course with the [London Taught Course Centre](http://www.ltcc.ac.uk). Practical matters:

  * **Lectures**: There are 5 lectures, given every Monday from 13th January until 10th February 2025, 3:10pm &#8211; 5:10pm at De Morgan house in London. 
  * **Lecture notes**: These will be put online the morning after the lecture is given. Each lecture contains many exercises which students are encouraged to attempt. Answers to starred exercises will be put online after one week. 
  * **Exam**: Information will be provided in due course.

Course material follows.
