I was recently alerted to a <a href = "https://euro-math-soc.eu/news/19/05/14/ems-statement-arrest-prof-tuna-altinel">European Maths Society statement on the arrest of Professor Tuna Altinel</a>. I reproduce that statement below. The situation sounds bad, and I so I am posting here to alert members of the mathematical community to what is going on. If you wish to show solidarity with Professor Altinel, then you can do so by signing the petition <a href = "http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/SoutienTunaAltinel/?lang=en">here</a>.

### EMS Statement on the Arrest of Prof Tuna Altinel

> Last week the mathematician Tuna Altinel, member of the European Mathematical Society and professor at the Université Lyon 1 in France, was arrested in Turkey after he had his passport extracted by the police. Tuna Altinel was one of the signatories of the peace petition supported by more than 2000 scientists and intellectuals against military actions towards civilians.

> The European Mathematical Society condemns this violation of Prof Altinel’s human rights and demands that he is immediately released and allowed to return to France to resume his teaching and research.
