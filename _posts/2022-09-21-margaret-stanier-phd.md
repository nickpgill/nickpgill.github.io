Congratulations to Margaret Stanier who has successfully defended her PhD thesis entitled *Farey maps, spectra and integer continued fractions*. I was a second supervisor for Margaret; my colleague, Ian Short was the Director of Studies for Margaret's research.

Margaret's research has resulted in two papers, both connected closely to the *Farey map*, a beautiful mathematical object with connections to many areas of mathematics. The papers are:

Stanier, M. *Regular coverings and parallel products of Farey maps*, Acta Math. Univ. Comen., New Ser. 91, No. 1, 1-18 (2022).

Short, I. and Stanier, M. *Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of integer continued fractions*, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 150, No. 2, 617-631 (2022).
