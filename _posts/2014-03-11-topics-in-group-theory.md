This website is for the 4th year course at the Universidad de Costa Rica starting Monday 10th March, 2014.

**Practical matters**

  * **Lectures**: There are two lectures per week (Monday, 15:00 &#8211; 17:50 and Thursday, 16:00 &#8211; 17:50) in Room 400. There will be 80 hours of lectures in total.
  * **Lecture notes**: These will be put online on Thursday afternoon each week.
  * **Office hours**: Mondays 2 &#8211; 3pm and Thursdays 2 &#8211; 4pm.
  * **Assessment**: There will be two exams, each counting 40% of the total mark. The remaining 20% of the mark will be for exercises. 
      * The first exam has happened. Answers are [here](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/05/exam1withanswers.pdf).
      * The second exam has happened. Answers are [here](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/07/exam2withsolutions.pdf). 
  * **[La carta al estudiante](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/carta_al_estudiante_2014a2.pdf)** (in Spanish).

 **Background reading**
  
No one text covers all of the material in this course. Principal texts are as follows:
                                                                        
  * John D. Dixon and Brian Mortimer, _Permutation groups_, Graduate Texts in Mathematics, vol. 163, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1996.
  * Peter Cameron&#8217;s notes on [Classical Groups](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/class_gps/);
  * Peter Cameron&#8217;s notes on [Projective and polar spaces](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~pjc/pps/) (First edition published as QMW Maths Notes 13 in 1991).
                                                                        
 Additional texts of interest:
                                                                        
  * Harald Simmons, [An introduction to category theory](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ hsimmons/zCATS.pdf). (I drew on a very small part of these notes when I wrote the chapter on category theory.)
  * Jean Dieudonne, _La geometrie des groupes classiques_. This is a classic, in French.
  * Peter Kleidman and Martin Liebeck, _The subgroup structure of the finite classical groups_. This proves a refined version of Aschbacher’s theorem on the subgroup structure of the finite classical groups. It also contains a wealth of other information on these groups (and other almost simple groups).
  * Donald Taylor, _The geometry of the classical groups_. This covers all the material in the second half of this course plus a fair bit more.
  * Helmut Wielandt, _Finite permutation groups_. Another classic giving a good sense of the major themes in the development of the theory of finite permutation groups.
  * Robert Wilson, _Finite simple groups_. Related lecture notes are [online](http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~raw/FSG/).
  * Joanna Fawcett, [The O’Nan-Scott theorem for finite primitive permutation groups](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/4534/Fawcett_Joanna.pdf). A very nice Masters thesis giving a self-contained proof of the O’Nan-Scott theorem.
                                                                        
 I have e-copies of most of the texts listed above and can provide them on request.
