I just got back from a conference at <a href = "http://www.birs.ca">Banff International Research Station</a> on "Groups and Geometries". Many thanks to Martin Liebeck, Inna Capdebosq and Bernhard Muelhuerr for organising a brilliant week. 

I gave a talk at the conference entitles "The relational complexity of a finite primitive permutation group", which I will embed below. The abstract of the talk was the following:
 
> Motivated by questions in model theory, Greg Cherlin introduced the idea of “relational
>  complexity”, a statistic connected to finite permutation groups. He also stated a conjecture
> classifying those permutation groups with minimal relational complexity. We report on recent 
> progress towards a proof of this conjecture. We also make some remarks about permutation
> groups with large relational complexity, and we explain how this statistic relates to others in the literature, notably base-size.
>
> This work is joint with Pablo Spiga, Martin Liebeck, Francesca Dalla Volta, Francis Hunt and Bianca Lodà."
