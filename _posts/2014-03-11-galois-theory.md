[Harald Helfgott](http://maths.bris.ac.uk/~mahah) and I are teaching Galois Theory in Teaching Block 1, starting October 2009. Information about (my part of) the course will appear below.

  * **Course page**: A description of the course, as it appeared in the handbook, can be found [here](http://www.maths.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergrad/current_units/unit/?id=183) 
  * **Timetable**: Lectures are at 9am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, starting Monday 5th October. The venue will be Portacabin Room 1. Great! 
  * **Notes**: Click [here](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/03/nicknotes.pdf) for notes covering the first nine sections (up to _Normal Extensions_). 
  * **Information about assessment**: Exercise Sheets [1](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/04/gtexercises1.pdf), [2](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/04/gtexercises2.pdf), and [3](http://boolesrings.org/nickgill/files/2014/04/gtexercises3.pdf) are available. I am not going to write up solutions unless I get a specific request (everything will be covered in the exercise class). Exam information will appear here in due course. 
  * **Texts**: I recommend you refer to the book by [Ian Stewart](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Galois-Theory-Chapman-Hall-Mathematics/dp/1584883936), or the one by [D.J. Garling](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g65XLke1wMMC&pg=PR7&lpg=PR7&dq=Garling+Galois+Theory&source=bl&ots=X5ubMwbNbo&sig=6kfKso3CAAyHLxEyA52zCx4mWaY&hl=en&ei=40emStP1KpqZjAeMxY2hDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false). For Stewart&#8217;s book (editions 2 and 3), you can find errata, and other supplementary material, [here](http://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/).
