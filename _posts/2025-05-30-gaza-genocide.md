A week ago 300 writers signed a letter demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire. The purpose of this post is to endorse, without reservation, the [text of that letter](https://medium.com/@horatioclare/writers-demand-immediate-gaza-ceasefire-65ae44bd7241).

What is happening in Gaza is terrible. I feel entirely helpless to affect any change for the people of Gaza but at the very least I can add my voice to those bearing witness to what is happening. To that end I reproduce the final sentence of the writers' letter:

> This genocide implicates us all. We bear witness to the crimes of genocide, and we refuse to approve them by our silence.
