Right, start by taking a selfie of your team and sending it to the WhatsApp group. Let's generate some memories, yeah?
</p>
<p>
Once you've done that, please click on the link below. You will need to play <b>three games</b> of the popular word game <b>BARNACLE</b>. Please remember the answers to your 3 games because it will be important to know <u>what 3 words</u> you got for your answers.
</p>
<p>
When you've played your 3 games, click on the link at the bottom of the next page. Good luck!
