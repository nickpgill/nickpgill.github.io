### What I learned

```js
if (event.key === "Backspace") {
    const inputs = document.querySelectorAll("input:not([disabled])");
    const currentIndex = Array.from(inputs).indexOf(document.activeElement);

    if (currentIndex >= 0) {
        const currentInput = inputs[currentIndex];
        const prevInput = inputs[currentIndex - 1];

        if (currentInput.value === "" && prevInput) {
            prevInput.value = "";
            prevInput.focus();
            currentInput.classList.remove("active");
        } else {
            currentInput.value = "";
        }
    }
