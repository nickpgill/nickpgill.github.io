OK, first thing's first, you need to compose a limerick and post a video of you reciting it to the WhatsApp group. <b>Make sure you don't give away your location in the video!!!</b> The limerick must start...
</p>
<p align = center>
<i>There once was a man called Steve...</i>
</p>
<p>
Done your limerick? Now here's your task: You need to go into the treasures gallery and find three numbers connected to inspiring figures or groups:
</p>
 1. Angela Davis was a hero for the 20th Convention of the Communist Party in the year XXXX.
 2. The Greenham women set up XXX peace camps in Britian on 9th November '83.
 3. A letter written by Alan Turing. His phone number was Molesey XXXX.
<p>
Add these three numbers together and you will get a four digit number.  When you enter your answer, don't just press enter, you have to click the button!
</p>
<form>
    <label for="pswd">Enter your answer, a 4 digit number: </label>
    <input type="password" id="pswd">
    <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="checkPswd();" />
</form>
<!--Function to check password the already set password is admin-->
<script type="text/javascript">
    function checkPswd() {
        var confirmPassword = "3454";
        var password = document.getElementById("pswd").value;
        if (password == confirmPassword) {
             window.location="p5";
        }
        else{
            alert("Whoops! Try again!");
        }
    }
</script>
